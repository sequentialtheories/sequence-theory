<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's initial goal was to unify two applications with a shared Supabase backend, featuring an automated, invisible wallet creation process using Turnkey. This was coupled with a request to fix and optimize a Digital Asset Indices feature that had unrealistic data visualization and was prone to crashing.

However, the project underwent a significant architectural pivot based on a new, non-negotiable principle: to create a **100% non-custodial wallet experience**. The user must have full and exclusive control over their private keys and seed phrase, generated entirely on the client side. The backend must have no signing authority or ability to move user funds.

Following this, the user requested a series of UI/UX enhancements to the homepage and other pages to achieve a cleaner, more professional aesthetic inspired by modern fintech sites, and to update the website's text content to align with a provided whitepaper.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **100% Non-Custodial Wallets:** Users must generate and control their own wallets client-side. The application provider (Sequence Theory) must have zero access to private keys, seed phrases, or the ability to sign transactions on the user's behalf.
2.  **Web2-Style UX:** The user onboarding and wallet creation process should feel like a standard web application (email/password signup), without exposing crypto jargon. New users are immediately redirected to a wallet setup flow post-registration.
3.  **Optimized & Realistic Indices:** The Digital Asset Indices feature must display realistic, non-crashing candlestick charts with correctly ordered volatility (Anchor5: low, Vibe20: moderate, Wave100: high) and a constant index score regardless of the selected time frame. The Wave100 index must be equal-weighted.
4.  **Modernized UI/UX:** The homepage and core layout should be enhanced for a clean, professional, and intuitive user experience, including a structured scroll-flow, visual enhancements like background animations, and preview sections for other parts of the site (Indices, FAQ).
5.  **Content Alignment:** All marketing and informational text on the Home and Learn More pages must align exactly with the content provided in the user's whitepaper.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend using Supabase for auth/DB.

-   **Backend ():** The backend has been stripped of all wallet-provisioning logic. Its sole responsibilities are now serving the sophisticated financial data for the Indices charts (via ) and a health check. The Turnkey integration has been completely removed.
-   **Frontend ():** The frontend has been massively refactored to support a 100% non-custodial wallet system using .
    -   A new client-side wallet generation and management flow exists under  and .
    -   New users are redirected to a  page immediately after registration to create their wallet and securely back up their seed phrase.
    -   The UI for the Home page () and related components (, ) has been significantly enhanced with a modern design, new sections (Indices/FAQ previews), and a fixed background animation.
    -   Content on the  and  pages has been updated to match the user's whitepaper.
    -   The Profile page now has working Sign Out and Delete Account buttons.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS, **ethers.js** (for client-side wallet generation)
-   **Database & Auth:** Supabase
-   **Client-Side Cryptography:** Using  to create wallets and the browser's  API (PBKDF2) to derive an encryption key from the user's password to securely store the encrypted seed phrase in .

**key DB schema**
-   **profiles:**  (Schema unchanged, but  is now populated from the client).

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Turnkey API:** Completely removed.
-   **ethers.js:** Added to the frontend to handle all cryptographic wallet operations.
-   **Backend Logic:** Significantly simplified, removing all responsibilities related to wallet management and private keys.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the fixed logic for the  endpoint.
-   : The completely overhauled home page.
-   : Page with content updated from whitepaper.
-   : The core of the new client-side wallet logic.
-   : The React context managing the wallet state.
-   : The dedicated page for the new user wallet creation flow.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The old Supabase Edge functions might still exist in the filesystem () and should be deleted to prevent confusion, as all their logic has been removed or migrated.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Expects  query param. Returns sophisticated candlestick data.
-   : **DELETED**.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **NON-CUSTODIAL IS LAW:** The project's architecture has fundamentally changed. The backend has **zero** authority or capability to create, manage, or sign with user wallets. All wallet logic is, and must remain, on the client-side. Do not re-introduce any backend wallet functionality.
-   **Client-Side Wallet Security:** The wallet's encrypted seed phrase is stored in the browser's . The encryption key is derived from the user's password and a salt. This means the user's password is required to unlock the wallet on each new device/browser.
-   **UI/UX Focus:** The user has a strong preference for a clean, modern, and intuitive UI. Pay close attention to visual hierarchy, spacing, and user flow.

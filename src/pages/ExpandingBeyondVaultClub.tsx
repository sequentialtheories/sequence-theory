            Think of your investment journey like learning to ride a bike. Vault Club contracts are like having training wheels - 
            they keep you stable while you learn the basics. But eventually, you might want to take off those training wheels and ride on your own.

            Expanding beyond Vault Club doesn't mean abandoning structured approaches entirely. 
            It means gradually taking on more control and responsibility as your knowledge and confidence grow.

              Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of price.

              Never put all your eggs in one basket. A good rule of thumb:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
              <li>No single asset should be more than 25% of your digital asset portfolio</li>
              <li>No speculative asset should be more than 5% of your total portfolio</li>
              <li>Consider correlation - don't buy 10 similar projects thinking you're diversified</li>
            </ul>

          You don't have to go from 0 to 100 overnight. A smart approach is to gradually increase your direct investing while maintaining some structured exposure:

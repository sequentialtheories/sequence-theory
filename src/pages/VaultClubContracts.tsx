          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-cyan-800">Think of It Like a Managed Investment Fund</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Imagine you want to invest in the stock market, but you don't know which stocks to pick. So you give your money to a professional fund manager who picks stocks for you. 
            Vault Club contracts work similarly, but for digital assets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Instead of you trying to figure out which cryptocurrencies to buy, when to buy them, and how to store them safely, 
            you enter into a contract where professionals handle all of that complexity for you.

            <li><strong>You invest your money:</strong> You contribute a certain amount to the contract</li>
            <li><strong>Professional management:</strong> Experienced traders and algorithms manage the digital assets</li>
            <li><strong>Diversified exposure:</strong> Your money gets spread across multiple digital assets and strategies</li>
            <li><strong>Regular returns:</strong> You receive returns based on the performance of the underlying assets</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You can track the performance and see what's happening with your investment</li>

              The contracts use sophisticated risk management techniques that would take years for you to learn and implement yourself.

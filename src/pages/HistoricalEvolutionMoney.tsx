        <h2>The Journey of Money Through Time</h2>
        <p>
          Money has undergone remarkable transformations throughout human history, each evolution reflecting
          the changing needs of society and technological advancement.
        </p>

        <h3>The Barter System (Pre-3000 BCE)</h3>
        <p>
          Before money existed, people traded goods and services directly. While this worked for simple
          societies, it had major limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Required a double coincidence of wants</li>
          <li>Difficult to determine fair exchange rates</li>
          <li>No way to store value for future use</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Commodity Money (3000 BCE - 600 BCE)</h3>
        <p>
          The first form of money was commodity money - items with intrinsic value used for trade:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cattle, grain, and salt in agricultural societies</li>
          <li>Shells and beads for their rarity and beauty</li>
          <li>Precious metals like gold and silver</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coined Money (600 BCE - 1000 CE)</h3>
        <p>
          The invention of coins marked a major advancement. Lydia (modern-day Turkey) created the first
          coins around 650 BCE, offering:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standardized value and weight</li>
          <li>Government backing and authenticity</li>
          <li>Portability and durability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paper Money (1000 CE - 1971)</h3>
        <p>
          China introduced paper money during the Tang Dynasty, eventually leading to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier transportation of large sums</li>
          <li>Banking systems and credit</li>
          <li>The gold standard and later fiat currencies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Digital Money (1971 - Present)</h3>
        <p>
          The end of the gold standard in 1971 ushered in the era of fiat currencies, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electronic banking and credit cards</li>
          <li>Online payment systems</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lessons from History</h3>
        <p>

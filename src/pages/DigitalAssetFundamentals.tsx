        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Are Digital Assets?</h2>
        
        <div className="bg-cyan-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-cyan-800">Think of Digital Assets Like Digital Gold</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Imagine if you could take gold, but instead of keeping it in a vault, you could store it on your computer or phone. 
            That's basically what digital assets are - valuable things that exist only in digital form, secured by super-strong computer math.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The most famous digital asset is Bitcoin, but there are thousands of others. Think of Bitcoin like digital gold - 
            it's scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins), it's valuable, and people use it to store wealth.
          </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Blockchain: A Digital Ledger Book</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          To understand digital assets, you need to understand blockchain. Think of blockchain like a very special notebook:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-800">The Magic Notebook</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Everyone has a copy:</strong> Thousands of people have identical copies of this notebook</li>
            <li><strong>You can't erase anything:</strong> Once something is written, it's permanent</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone must agree:</strong> Before adding a new page, most people must agree it's correct</li>
            <li><strong>It's transparent:</strong> Anyone can read the notebook, but your identity stays private</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            This notebook keeps track of who owns what digital assets. When you "send" Bitcoin to someone, 
            you're really just updating the notebook to show they now own it instead of you.
          </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Why Are Digital Assets Valuable?</h3>
        
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-green-800">Scarcity</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Many digital assets have a limited supply. Bitcoin, for example, will never have more than 21 million coins. 
              This scarcity can make them valuable, like rare baseball cards or limited edition sneakers.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-800">Utility</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Some digital assets can do things - like power applications, facilitate transactions, or provide access to services. 
              It's like having a token that not only has value but also unlocks special features.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Wild West of Digital Assets</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Digital assets are exciting, but they're also like the Wild West - lots of opportunity, but also lots of danger. 
          Here's what makes them different from traditional investments:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-yellow-800">Extreme Volatility</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Digital asset prices can swing wildly. Imagine if your car's value changed by 20% every day - that's what digital assets can be like. 
            This volatility creates opportunities for big gains, but also big losses.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Bitcoin once dropped 80% from its high in 2018</li>
            <li>But it also gained over 1000% in 2017</li>
            <li>Some altcoins can gain or lose 50% in a single day</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Types of Digital Assets</h3>
        
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <div className="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-orange-800">Cryptocurrencies</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These are digital money. Bitcoin is like digital gold (store of value), while others like Ethereum are like digital oil (they power other applications).
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-pink-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-pink-800">Utility Tokens</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These give you access to services or products. Think of them like arcade tokens - you need them to play the games (use the services).
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-800">Stablecoins</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These are designed to have stable value, usually pegged to the US dollar. They're like digital dollars - less exciting, but more predictable.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Market Dynamics: Supply and Demand</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Digital asset prices are driven by the same forces as any market - supply and demand. But several factors make this more complex:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-red-800">What Drives Prices?</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>News and sentiment:</strong> Good news can pump prices, bad news can crash them</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> More people and companies using digital assets increases demand</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Government rules can dramatically impact prices</li>
            <li><strong>Technology updates:</strong> Improvements to the underlying technology can increase value</li>
            <li><strong>Market manipulation:</strong> Large holders can sometimes influence prices</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Risks You Need to Know</h3>
        
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-red-800">Technical Risks</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
              <li>Losing your private keys (like losing the key to your safe)</li>
              <li>Sending assets to the wrong address</li>
              <li>Exchange hacks</li>
              <li>Software bugs</li>
            </ul>

          <div className="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-orange-800">Market Risks</h4>

              <li>Market manipulation</li>
              <li>Liquidity issues</li>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Why Start with Structured Approaches?</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Given all these risks and complexities, jumping directly into buying individual digital assets is like trying to perform surgery without medical training. 
          That's why structured investment approaches, like Vault Club contracts, can be valuable for beginners.

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-green-800">Benefits of Structured Approaches</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Professional management reduces your learning curve</li>
            <li>Diversification across multiple assets reduces risk</li>
            <li>Systematic strategies remove emotional decision-making</li>

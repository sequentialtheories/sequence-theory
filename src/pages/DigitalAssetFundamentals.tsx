        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Are Digital Assets?</h2>
        
        <div className="bg-cyan-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-cyan-800">Assets Made of Code</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Digital assets are valuable items that exist purely as computer code. Unlike traditional assets like stocks or real estate, 
            they have no physical form - they're essentially sophisticated software programs that represent ownership, value, or utility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The most well-known digital asset is Bitcoin, but there are thousands of others. What makes them "assets" is that people 
            assign value to them based on their scarcity, utility, or the problems they solve. Think of them as programmable value - 
            code that can store, transfer, and create wealth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Blockchain: A Digital Ledger Book</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          To understand digital assets, you need to understand blockchain. Think of blockchain like a very special notebook:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-800">The Magic Notebook</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Everyone has a copy:</strong> Thousands of people have identical copies of this notebook</li>
            <li><strong>You can't erase anything:</strong> Once something is written, it's permanent</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone must agree:</strong> Before adding a new page, most people must agree it's correct</li>
            <li><strong>It's transparent:</strong> Anyone can read the notebook, but your identity stays private</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            This notebook keeps track of who owns what digital assets. When you "send" Bitcoin to someone, 
            you're really just updating the notebook to show they now own it instead of you.
          </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Types of Digital Assets</h3>
        
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <div className="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-orange-800">Cryptocurrencies</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These function as digital money. Bitcoin acts as a store of value (like digital savings), while others like Ethereum 
              power applications and smart contracts. Their value comes from their adoption as mediums of exchange and stores of wealth.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-pink-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-pink-800">Utility Tokens</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These give you access to specific services or products within a digital ecosystem. Think of them like arcade tokens - 
              you need them to use certain applications or services. Their value is tied to the demand for those services.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-indigo-800">Stablecoins</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              These are designed to maintain stable value, usually pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. 
              They're less volatile but offer utility for transactions and as a bridge between traditional and digital finance.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What Drives Digital Asset Value?</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Understanding why digital assets have value requires looking at how different types derive their worth and how market forces affect them:
        </p>

        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
          <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-green-800">Scarcity & Supply Limits</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Many digital assets have programmed scarcity. Bitcoin will never exceed 21 million coins, creating digital scarcity. 
              This limited supply can drive value as demand increases, similar to any scarce resource.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-800">Utility & Network Effects</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Utility tokens gain value from the services they unlock. As more people use a blockchain network, 
              the tokens that power it become more valuable. Ethereum's value partly comes from powering thousands of applications.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Market Dynamics: The Forces at Play</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Digital asset prices are driven by the same basic forces as any market - supply and demand - but several unique factors make this more complex:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-red-800">Value Drivers Across Asset Types</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Adoption & Network Growth:</strong> More users increase demand for cryptocurrencies and utility tokens</li>
            <li><strong>Technological Development:</strong> Upgrades and improvements can increase an asset's utility and value</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> Government policies dramatically impact all digital asset types</li>
            <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> News, social media, and investor psychology drive short-term price movements</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Investment:</strong> Large investors entering the market affects supply and legitimacy</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Use Cases:</strong> Actual utility and problem-solving capability drives long-term value</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-yellow-800">The Volatility Reality</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Digital asset prices can swing wildly because the market is still relatively small and immature. 
            A single news event or large transaction can move prices dramatically across all asset types.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Bitcoin once dropped 80% from its high in 2018, then gained over 300% in 2020-2021</li>
            <li>Utility tokens can gain or lose 50% in a single day based on project announcements</li>
            <li>Even stablecoins occasionally "break their peg" during market stress</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The Wild West of Digital Assets</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Digital assets are exciting, but they're also like the Wild West - lots of opportunity, but also lots of danger. 
          Here's what makes them different from traditional investments:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
              <li>Losing your private keys (like losing the key to your safe)</li>
              <li>Sending assets to the wrong address</li>
              <li>Exchange hacks</li>
              <li>Software bugs</li>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Why Start with Structured Approaches?</h3>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Given all these risks and complexities, jumping directly into buying individual digital assets is like trying to perform surgery without medical training. 
          That's why structured investment approaches, like Vault Club contracts, can be valuable for beginners.

            <li>Professional management reduces your learning curve</li>
            <li>Diversification across multiple assets and types reduces risk</li>
            <li>Systematic strategies remove emotional decision-making</li>
            <li>You can learn while your money is still working for you</li>
            <li>Exposure to different asset types without needing to understand each one deeply</li>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Understanding digital assets is just the beginning. The key is to start with approaches that match your knowledge level and risk tolerance. 
          As you learn more about different asset types and market dynamics, you can gradually take on more direct control of your investments.

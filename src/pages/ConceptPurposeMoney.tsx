        <h2>What Is Money?</h2>
        <p>
          Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade and commerce. At its core, money serves three fundamental purposes:
          storing value, measuring value, and enabling the exchange of goods and services.
        </p>

        <h3>The Three Functions of Money</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medium of Exchange:</strong> Money eliminates the need for bartering by providing a common currency</li>
          <li><strong>Store of Value:</strong> Money allows us to save purchasing power for future use</li>
          <li><strong>Unit of Account:</strong> Money provides a standard measure to compare the value of different goods and services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Money Exists</h3>
        <p>
          Before money, people relied on bartering - directly exchanging goods and services. This system had significant limitations:
          the need for a "double coincidence of wants" made trade inefficient and difficult to scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          Money emerged as a solution to these problems, enabling:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Efficient trade and commerce</li>
          <li>Economic specialization</li>
          <li>Capital accumulation</li>
          <li>Complex economic systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Money's Role in Society</h3>
        <p>
          Money is more than just a tool for transactions - it's a social technology that enables cooperation,
          innovation, and progress. It allows societies to organize complex economic activities and allocate
          resources efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>The Revolution of True Digital Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology has introduced the concept of true digital ownership for the first time in history.
          This represents a fundamental shift from traditional digital assets that are merely licensed to users.
        </p>

        <h3>Traditional vs. True Digital Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the difference between traditional digital assets and blockchain-based ownership:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional Digital:</strong> You license content from platforms (iTunes, Steam, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Blockchain Digital:</strong> You own the asset through cryptographic proof</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Dependency:</strong> Traditional assets can be revoked by platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Sovereignty:</strong> Blockchain assets are controlled by private keys</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Digital Ownership Enables</h3>

          <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Use assets across different platforms and games</li>
          <li><strong>Permanence:</strong> Assets exist independent of any single platform</li>
          <li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Assets can have built-in rules and behaviors</li>
          <li><strong>Composability:</strong> Combine assets to create new experiences</li>

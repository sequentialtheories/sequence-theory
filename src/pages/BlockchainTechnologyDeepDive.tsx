        <h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain is the foundational technology that powers cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications.
          It's a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
          which are linked and secured using cryptography.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is a Blockchain?</h3>
        <p>
          Think of a blockchain as a digital ledger book that's copied across thousands of computers worldwide.
          Every time someone makes a transaction, it gets recorded in this book, and all computers must agree
          on what happened before it becomes permanent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> No single point of control or failure</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> All transactions are publicly visible</li>
          <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Once recorded, data cannot be easily changed</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptographically Secure:</strong> Uses advanced encryption</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Blocks Are Created</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the process of how new blocks are added to the blockchain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transaction Pool:</strong> New transactions wait in a mempool</li>
          <li><strong>Block Formation:</strong> Miners/validators select transactions to include</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of Work/Stake:</strong> Consensus mechanism validates the block</li>
          <li><strong>Block Addition:</strong> Validated block is added to the chain</li>
          <li><strong>Network Sync:</strong> All nodes update their copy of the blockchain</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>
          How blockchain networks agree on the state of the ledger:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Miners compete to solve computational puzzles</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> Validators are chosen based on their stake</li>
          <li><strong>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):</strong> Token holders vote for validators</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of Authority (PoA):</strong> Pre-approved validators secure the network</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hash Functions and Cryptography</h3>
        <p>
          The mathematical foundation that secures blockchain networks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cryptographic Hashing:</strong> Creates unique fingerprints for data</li>
          <li><strong>SHA-256:</strong> The hashing algorithm used by Bitcoin</li>
          <li><strong>Merkle Trees:</strong> Efficiently organize and verify transactions</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Prove ownership and authorize transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Blockchain Networks</h3>
        <p>
          Different models of blockchain implementation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Public Blockchains:</strong> Open to everyone (Bitcoin, Ethereum)</li>
          <li><strong>Private Blockchains:</strong> Restricted access for organizations</li>
          <li><strong>Consortium Blockchains:</strong> Semi-decentralized, controlled by groups</li>
          <li><strong>Hybrid Blockchains:</strong> Combination of public and private elements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>
          Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automated Execution:</strong> Run automatically when conditions are met</li>
          <li><strong>Trustless:</strong> No need to trust intermediaries</li>
          <li><strong>Programmable Money:</strong> Enable complex financial instruments</li>
          <li><strong>Immutable Logic:</strong> Contract terms cannot be changed once deployed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blockchain Trilemma</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental challenge in blockchain design:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single point of control</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> Resistance to attacks and manipulation</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability to handle many transactions quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most blockchains can only optimize for two of these three properties at once,
          leading to different design choices and trade-offs.
        </p>

        <h3>Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the blockchain scaling landscape:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layer 1 (Base Layer):</strong> Main blockchain protocols (Bitcoin, Ethereum)</li>
          <li><strong>Layer 2 (Scaling Solutions):</strong> Built on top of Layer 1 for speed and cost</li>
          <li><strong>State Channels:</strong> Off-chain transactions with periodic settlement</li>
          <li><strong>Sidechains:</strong> Separate blockchains connected to the main chain</li>
          <li><strong>Rollups:</strong> Bundle multiple transactions into one on-chain transaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Network Effects and Adoption</h3>

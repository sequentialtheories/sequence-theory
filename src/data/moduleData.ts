When you buy Apple stock, you're betting that Apple will make more money in the future. Simple concept, but the execution? That's where most people get destroyed.

**How It Works:**
‚Ä¢ **Primary Markets**: IPOs - Companies going public for the first time
‚Ä¢ **Secondary Markets**: Daily trading - NYSE, NASDAQ, global exchanges

**Reality Check:**
‚Ä¢ 90% of day traders lose money
‚Ä¢ Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent  
‚Ä¢ Insider trading gives institutions massive advantages

The stock market is less about investing and more about psychology. Fear and greed drive prices more than fundamentals.`

Bonds used to be the "safe" part of portfolios. But when governments print money faster than your bond pays interest, you're guaranteed to lose purchasing power. "Safe" becomes dangerous.

**Types:**
‚Ä¢ **Government Bonds**: Treasuries, considered "risk-free" (until they're not)
‚Ä¢ **Corporate Bonds**: Higher yield, higher risk - companies can fail

**The Hidden Risk:**
When inflation rises faster than bond interest rates, fixed payments lose purchasing power. Your "safe" investment becomes a guaranteed loss against rising prices.`

These are real things people actually need. When paper money becomes questionable, smart money often flows to commodities. Gold doesn't care about your government's fiscal policy.

**The Categories:**
üî• **Energy**: Oil, gas, electricity
‚ú® **Precious Metals**: Gold, silver, platinum  
üåæ **Agriculture**: Wheat, corn, coffee
‚öôÔ∏è **Industrial**: Copper, steel, lumber

‚Ä¢ 24/7 trading across time zones
‚Ä¢ Major pairs: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY  
‚Ä¢ Central bank interventions move markets
‚Ä¢ Economic data releases cause volatility

**Brutal Reality:**

‚Ä¢ **Futures**: Contracts for future delivery  
‚Ä¢ **Swaps**: Exchange different cash flows

**Warning Signs:**
‚Ä¢ Can lose more than you invested
‚Ä¢ Complexity hides risks

**The Reality:**
‚Ä¢ Markets can be manipulated by large players
‚Ä¢ Liquidity disappears when you need it most
‚Ä¢ Capital often flows to speculation, not productivity

üí° **Key Insight**: Markets are efficient at transferring money from the impatient to the patient.

**What Works:**
‚Ä¢ Long-term investing in productive assets
‚Ä¢ Diversification across uncorrelated markets
‚Ä¢ Understanding what you're buying
‚Ä¢ Position sizing and risk management

**What Destroys Wealth:**
‚Ä¢ Trading without understanding
‚Ä¢ Chasing performance and hot markets  
‚Ä¢ Using excessive leverage
